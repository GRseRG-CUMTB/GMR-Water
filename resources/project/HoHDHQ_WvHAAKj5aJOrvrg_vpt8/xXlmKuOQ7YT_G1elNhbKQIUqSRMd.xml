<Info description="With the continuous development of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), contemporary receivers can capture multi-frequency signals from multiple GNSS systems, including GPS, Galileo, GLONASS, and BDS. This progress is undoubtedly conducive to the development of GNSS-MR technology. Moreover, traditional GNSS-MR water level retrieval techniques predominantly rely on Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) observations. Nevertheless, it has been demonstrated that both carrier phase and pseudo range observations also possess the potential for water level retrieval. Incidentally, there have been certain advancements in the combination methods for multi-frequency results as well. In response to these developments, we have developed a software named GMR-Water, which is based on MATLAB, for water level retrieval. This software accomplishes water level retrieval by utilizing multi-frequency, multi-system, and multi-observation values, thereby significantly augmenting the retrieval accuracy and temporal resolution in comparison to traditional techniques. Additionally, the software incorporates two multi-frequency fusion algorithms, generating water level retrieval information at uniform sampling intervals, thus further promoting the development of GNSS-MR water level retrieval technology."/>
